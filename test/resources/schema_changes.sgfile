# Add a new column, set it to be the old id + 10, make it PK and then delete the old ID.
# Currently this produces a snap for every action (since it's a schema change).

# NB This used to be several separate SQL commands. However, the new_id would be a null in the beginning, which meant
# that it couldn't be a part of a DIFF object (since in absence of a PK the DIFF is PKd on the whole tuple).
# Somehow this bug only showed up when WAL was changed to audit triggers to detect changes.
